      <p>Hello, My name is Nicholas C. Maas I am a web developer. I am creative to the bone, having an interest in the
        arts
        as a child, I grew to love design, and enjoy the creative process.
        From the idea stage to the finished project, weither it was drawing, painting, building, I found myself lost in
        a world of possibilities. Where the outcome was fully realized,
        the vision came to life and flourished. Who is Neko Carrera? I used to play in a rock band under the stage name
        Neko Carrera, which is a portmanteau of my favorite singer Neko Case, and my favorite sports car the Porsche
        Carrera. My work ethic is that of the blue collar worker, putting in maximum
        effort, to achieve my goals. getting results in the alloted time, and delivering
        the highest quality product, available for immediate use. With the user experience in mind, along with a design
        thats guaranteed to turn heads.</p>

  <p>Neko Carrera has only been around a short time in the developer community. He has made a few websites worthy of
    your attention.
    Such classics as my Hockey Quiz, which I loved creating. The Blues and Brews search engine that I helped create with
    the help of
    my DU bootcamp classmates Andrew Karpisz, and Anteneh Negera. I also developed a day planner that is pretty sweet
    too. I love what I do, so don't be afraid to contact me with your project.
    Every project no matter how big or small will get my full attention, so that you will be satisfied with the finished
    project. For a detailed view
    of the projects I have created, check out my portfolio page.
